  abstract  = {Vision-based control systems are key enablers of many autonomous vehicular systems, including self-driving cars. Testing such systems is complicated by complex and multidimensional input spaces. We propose an automated testing algorithm that builds on learnable evolutionary algorithms. These algorithms rely on machine learning or a combination of machine learning and Darwinian genetic operators to guide the generation of new solutions (test scenarios in our context). Our approach combines multiobjective population-based search algorithms and decision tree classification models to achieve the following goals: First, classification models guide the search-based generation of tests faster towards critical test scenarios (i.e., test scenarios leading to failures). Second, search algorithms refine classification models so that the models can accurately characterize critical regions (i.e., the regions of a test input space that are likely to contain most critical test scenarios). Our evaluation performed on an industrial automotive automotive system shows that: (1) Our algorithm outperforms a baseline evolutionary search algorithm and generates 78\% more distinct, critical test scenarios compared to the baseline algorithm. (2) Our algorithm accurately characterizes critical regions of the system under test, thus identifying the conditions that are likely to lead to system failures.},

  abstract   = {Modern autonomous systems require extensive testing to ensure reliability and build trust in ground vehicles. However, testing these systems in the real-world is challenging due to the lack of large and diverse datasets, especially in edge cases. Therefore, simulations are necessary for their development and evaluation. However, existing open-source simulators often exhibit a significant gap between synthetic and real-world domains, leading to deteriorated mobility performance and reduced platform reliability when using simulation data. To address this issue, our Scoping Autonomous Vehicle Simulation (SAVeS) platform benchmarks the performance of simulated environments for autonomous ground vehicle testing between synthetic and real-world domains. Our platform aims to quantify the domain gap and enable researchers to develop and test autonomous systems in a controlled environment. Additionally, we propose using domain adaptation technologies to address the domain gap between synthetic and real-world data with our SAVeS+ extension. Our results demonstrate that SAVeS+ is effective in helping to close the gap between synthetic and real-world domains and yields comparable performance for models trained with processed synthetic datasets to those trained on real-world datasets of same scale. Finally, we introduce two new autonomy driving datasets with complex scenes, essential sensor data, ground truth and improved imagery. The data is generated using both open-source and commercial simulators and processed through our SAVeS+ domain adaptation pipeline. This paper highlights our efforts to quantify and address the domain gap between synthetic and real-world data for autonomy simulation. By enabling researchers to develop and test autonomous systems in a controlled environment, we hope to bring autonomy simulation one step closer to realization.1},

While some companies claim that many cutting-edge automated driving functions have been developed, how to evaluate the safety of automated vehicles remains an open question, which has become a crucial bottleneck. Scenario-based testing has been introduced to test automated vehicles, and much progress has been achieved. While data-driven and knowledge-based approaches are hot research topics, this survey is mainly about Data-Driven Scenario Generation (DDSG) for automated vehicle testing. Rather than describe the contributions of every study respectively, in this survey, methodologies from various studies are anatomized as solutions for several significant problems and compared with each other. This way, scholars and engineers can quickly find state-of-the-art approaches to the issues they might encounter. Furthermore, several critical challenges that might hinder DDSG are described, and responding solutions are presented at the end of this survey.},

  abstract   = {The autonomous driving community has witnessed a rapid growth in approaches that embrace an end-to-end algorithm framework, utilizing raw sensor input to generate vehicle motion plans, instead of concentrating on individual tasks such as detection and motion prediction. End-to-end systems, in comparison to modular pipelines, benefit from joint feature optimization for perception and planning. This field has flourished due to the availability of large-scale datasets, closed-loop evaluation, and the increasing need for autonomous driving algorithms to perform effectively in challenging scenarios. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive analysis of more than 250 papers, covering the motivation, roadmap, methodology, challenges, and future trends in end-to-end autonomous driving. We delve into several critical challenges, including multi-modality, interpretability, causal confusion, robustness, and world models, amongst others. Additionally, we discuss current advancements in foundation models and visual pre-training, as well as how to incorporate these techniques within the end-to-end driving framework. To facilitate future research, we maintain an active repository that contains up-to-date links to relevant literature and open-source projects at https://github.com/{OpenDriveLab}/End-to-end-Autonomous-Driving.},

The complexity of these systems often precludes the use of formal veriﬁcation and real-world testing can be too dangerous during development. Therefore, simulation-based techniques have been developed that treat the system under test as a black box operating in a simulated environment. Safety validation tasks include ﬁnding disturbances in the environment that cause the system to fail (falsiﬁcation), ﬁnding the most-likely failure, and estimating the probability that the system fails. Motivated by the prevalence of safety-critical artiﬁcial intelligence, this work provides a survey of state-of-the-art safety validation techniques for {CPS} with a focus on applied algorithms and their modiﬁcations for the safety validation problem. We present and discuss algorithms in the domains of optimization, path planning, reinforcement learning, and importance sampling. Problem decomposition techniques are presented to help scale algorithms to large state spaces, which are common for {CPS}. A brief overview of safety-critical applications is given, including autonomous vehicles and aircraft collision avoidance systems. Finally, we present a survey of existing academic and commercially available safety validation tools.},

  abstract     = {Enabled by a rich ecosystem of Machine Learning ({ML}) libraries, programming using learned models, i.e., Software-2.0, has gained substantial adoption. However, we do not know what challenges developers encounter when they use {ML} libraries. With this knowledge gap, researchers miss opportunities to contribute to new research directions, tool builders do not invest resources where automation is most needed, library designers cannot make informed decisions when releasing {ML} library versions, and developers fail to use common practices when using {ML} libraries.We present the first large-scale quantitative and qualitative empirical study to shed light on how developers in Software-2.0 use {ML} libraries, and how this evolution affects their code. Particularly, using static analysis we perform a longitudinal study of 3,340 top-rated open-source projects with 46,110 contributors. To further understand the challenges of {ML} library evolution, we survey 109 developers who introduce and evolve {ML} libraries. Using this rich dataset we reveal several novel findings.Among others, we found an increasing trend of using {ML} libraries: The ratio of new Python projects that use {ML} libraries increased from 2\% in 2013 to 50\% in 2018. We identify several usage patterns including the following: (i) 36\% of the projects use multiple {ML} libraries to implement various stages of the {ML} workflows, (ii) developers update {ML} libraries more often than the traditional libraries, (iii) strict upgrades are the most popular for {ML} libraries among other update kinds, (iv) {ML} library updates often result in cascading library updates, and (v) {ML} libraries are often downgraded (22.04\% of cases). We also observed unique challenges when evolving and maintaining Software-2.0 such as (i) binary incompatibility of trained {ML} models and (ii) benchmarking {ML} models. Finally, we present actionable implications of our findings for researchers, tool builders, developers, educators, library vendors, and hardware vendors.},

  abstract   = {Identification of test scenarios for Automated Driving Systems ({ADSs}) remains a key challenge for the Verification \& Validation of {ADSs}. Various approaches including data based approaches and knowledge based approaches have been proposed for scenario generation. Identifying the conditions that lead to high severity traffic accidents can help us not only identify test scenarios for {ADSs}, but also implement measures to save lives and infrastructure resources. Taking a data based approach, in this paper, we introduce a novel accident data analysis method for generating test scenarios where we analyze {UK}'s Stats19 accident data to identify trends in high severity accidents for test scenario generation. This paper first focuses on the severity of the accidents with the goal of relating it to static and time-dependent internal and external factors in a comprehensive way taking into account Operational Design Domain ({ODD}) properties, e.g. road, environmental conditions, and vehicle properties and driver characteristics. For this purpose, the paper utilizes a data grouping strategy (coarse-graining) and builds a logistic regression approach, derived from conventional regression models, in which emerging features become more pronounced, while uninteresting features and noise weaken. The approach makes the relationship between the factors and outcome variable more visible and hence well suited for the severity analysis. The method shows superior performance as compared to ordinary logistic models measured by goodness of fit and accounting for model variance (R{\textasciicircum}2=0.05 for the ordinary model, R{\textasciicircum}2=0.85 for the current model). The model is then used to solve the inverse problem of constructing high-risk pre-crash conditions as test scenarios for simulation based testing of {ADSs}.},

  abstract  = {Autonomous driving carries the promise to drastically reduce the number of car accidents; however, recently reported fatal crashes involving self-driving cars show that such an important goal is not yet achieved. This calls for better testing of the software controlling self-driving cars, which is difficult because it requires producing challenging driving scenarios. To better test self-driving car soft- ware, we propose to specifically test car crash scenarios, which are critical par excellence. Since real car crashes are difficult to test in field operation, we recreate them as physically accurate simulations in an environment that can be used for testing self-driving car software. To cope with the scarcity of sensory data collected during real car crashes which does not enable a full reproduction, we extract the information to recreate real car crashes from the police reports which document them. Our extensive evaluation, consisting of a user study involving 34 participants and a quantitative analysis of the quality of the generated tests, shows that we can generate accurate simulations of car crashes in a matter of minutes. Compared to tests which implement non critical driving scenarios, our tests effectively stressed the test subject in different ways and exposed several shortcomings in its implementation.},

  abstract   = {Artiﬁcial Intelligence ({AI}) technologies are increasingly deployed to perform safety-critical tasks in various systems, including driverless vehicles. Therefore, ensuring the high quality of these {AI}-based systems is paramount to avoiding accidents and fatalities. Software testing has been proven to be a costeffective quality assurance method for traditional software systems but requires adaptations to address the peculiarities of {AI} applications. For instance, thoroughly testing the software controlling autonomous vehicles requires the deﬁnition of relevant driving scenarios and their implementation in physically accurate driving simulators, which remains an open challenge. Recent work showed that simulations of critical driving scenarios such as car crashes are fundamental to generating effective test cases. However, generating such complex simulations is challenging, and state-of-the-art approaches based on natural language descriptions struggle to complete the task. Therefore, we propose {CRISCE}, the ﬁrst approach to create accurate car crash simulations from accident sketches. Our extensive evaluation shows that {CRISCE} is efﬁcient, effective, and generates accurate simulations, drastically improving state-of-art approaches based on natural language processing.},

Existing studies have obtained rarer events by sampling methods in a fixed scenario space. In reality, heterogeneous drivers behave differently when facing the same situation. To generate more realistic and efficient scenarios, we propose a two-stage heterogeneous driver model to change the number of dangerous scenarios in the scenario space. We trained the driver model using the {HighD} dataset, and generated scenarios through simulation. Simulations were conducted in 20 experimental groups with heterogeneous driver models and 5 control groups with the original driver model. The results show that, by adjusting the number and position of aggressive drivers, the percentage of dangerous scenarios was significantly higher compared to that of models not accounting for driver heterogeneity. To further verify the effectiveness of our method, we evaluated two driving strategies: car-following and cut-in scenarios. The results verify the effectiveness of our approach. Cumulatively, the results indicate that our approach could accelerate the testing of {AVs}.},

  abstract   = {Adequately exercising the behaviors of autonomous vehicles is fundamental to their validation. However, quantifying an autonomous vehicle’s testing adequacy is challenging as the system’s behavior is influenced both by its state as well as its physical environment. To address this challenge, our work builds on two insights. First, data sensed by an autonomous vehicle provides a unique spatial signature of the physical environment inputs. Second, given the vehicle’s current state, inputs residing outside the autonomous vehicle’s physically reachable regions are less relevant to its behavior. Building on those insights, we introduce an abstraction that enables the computation of a physical environment-state coverage metric, {PhysCov}. The abstraction combines the sensor readings with a physical reachability analysis based on the vehicle’s state and dynamics to determine the region of the environment that may affect the autonomous vehicle. It then characterizes that region through a parameterizable geometric approximation that can trade quality for cost. Tests with the same characterizations are deemed to have had similar internal states and exposed to similar environments and thus likely to exercise the same set of behaviors, while tests with distinct characterizations will increase {PhysCov}. A study on two simulated and one real system’s dataset examines {PhysCovs}’s ability to quantify an autonomous vehicle’s test suite, showcases its characterization cost and precision, investigates its correlation with failures found and potential for test selection, and assesses its ability to distinguish among real-world scenarios.},

  abstract   = {Autonomous Vehicles ({AV})'s wide-scale deployment appears imminent despite many safety challenges yet to be resolved. The modern autonomous vehicles will undoubtedly include machine learning and probabilistic techniques that add significant complexity to the traditional verification and validation methods. Road testing is essential before the deployment, but scenarios are repeatable, and it's hard to collect challenging events. Exploring numerous, diverse and crucial scenarios is a time-consuming and expensive approach. The research community and industry have widely accepted scenario-based testing in the last few years. As it is focused directly on the relevant critical road situations, it can reduce the effort required in testing. The scenario-based testing in simulation requires the realistic behaviour of the traffic participants to assess the System Under Test ({SUT}). It is essential to capture the scenarios from the real world to encode the behaviour of actual traffic participants. This paper proposes a novel scenario extraction method to capture the lane change scenarios using point-cloud data and object tracking information. This method enables fully automatic scenario extraction compared to similar approaches in this area. The generated scenarios are represented in {OpenX} format to reuse them in the {SUT} evaluation easily. The motivation of this framework is to build a validation dataset to generate many critical concrete scenarios.

A systematic literature review is a means of evaluating and interpreting all available research relevant to a particular research question, topic area, or phenomenon of interest. 
              Systematic reviews aim to present a fair evaluation of a research topic by using a trustworthy, rigorous, and auditable methodology. The guidelines presented in this report were derived from three existing guidelines used by medical researchers, two books produced by researchers with social science backgrounds and discussions with researchers from other disciplines who are involved
              in evidence-based practice. The guidelines have been adapted to reflect the specific problems of software engineering research.
              The guidelines cover three phases of a systematic literature review: planning the review, conducting the review and reporting the review. They provide a relatively high level description. They do not consider the impact of the research questions on the review procedures, nor do they specify in detail the mechanisms needed to perform meta-analysis.},

State-of-theart approaches ﬁrst generate a huge amount of test scenarios through simulations or test drives, which are later ﬁltered to obtain relevant scenarios for a given set of speciﬁcations. However, only few works exist on synthesizing scenarios directly from speciﬁcations. In this work, we present an optimizationbased approach to synthesize scenarios only from formal speciﬁcations and a given map. To concretize the speciﬁcations, we formulate predicates, which are subsequently converted to a mixed-integer quadratic optimization problem. We demonstrate how our method can generate scenarios for maps featuring merging lanes and intersections given a variety of speciﬁcations.},

  abstract     = {The deployment of intelligent connected vehicles ({ICVs}) is regarded as a significant solution to improve road safety, transportation management, and energy efficiency. This study assessed the safety, traffic, environmental, and industrial economic benefits of {ICV} deployment in China under different scenarios. A bottom-up model was established to deal with these impacts within a unified framework, based on the existing theories and literature of {ICVs}’ cost–benefit analysis, as well as China’s most recent policies and statistics. The results indicate that the total benefits may reach 13.25 to 24.02 trillion renminbi ({RMB}) in 2050, while a cumulative benefit–cost ratio of 1.15 to 3.06 suggests high cost-effectiveness. However, if the government and industry only focus on their own interests, the break-even point may be delayed by several years. Hence, an effective business model is necessary to enhance public–private cooperation in {ICV} implementation. Meanwhile, the savings of travel time costs and fleet labor costs play an important part in all socioeconomic impacts. Therefore, the future design of {ICVs} should pay more attention to the utilization of in-vehicle time and the real substitution for human drivers.},

With this widened scope, new types of landscapes have emerged such as multiobjective landscapes, violation landscapes, dynamic and coupled landscapes and error landscapes. This survey is a follow-up from a 2013 survey on fitness landscapes and includes an additional 11 landscape analysis techniques. The paper also includes a survey on the applications of landscape analysis for understanding complex problems and explaining algorithm behaviour, as well as algorithm performance prediction and automated algorithm configuration and selection. The extensive use of landscape analysis in a broad range of areas highlights the wide applicability of the techniques and the paper discusses some opportunities for further research in this growing field.},

  abstract  = {In many areas, such as image recognition, natural language processing, search, recommendation, autonomous cars, systems software and infrastructure, and even Software Engineering tools themselves, Software 2.0 (= programming using learned models) is quickly swallowing Software 1.0 (= programming using handcrafted algorithms). Where the Software 1.0 Engineer formally specifies their problem, carefully designs algorithms, composes systems out of subsystems or decomposes complex systems into smaller components, the Software 2.0 Engineer amasses training data and simply feeds it into an {ML} algorithm that will synthesize an approximation of the function whose partial extensional definition is that training data. Instead of code as the artifact of interest, in Software 2.0 it is all about the data where compilation of source code is replaced by training models with data. This new style of programming has far-reaching consequences for traditional software engineering practices. Everything we have learned about life cycle models, project planning and estimation, requirements analysis, program design, construction, debugging, testing, maintenance and implementation, … runs the danger of becoming obsolete.  One way to try to prepare for the new realities of software engineering is not to zero in on the differences between Software 1.0 and Software 2.0 but instead focus on their similarities. If you carefully look at what a neural net actually represents, you realize that in essence it is a pure function, from multi-dimensional arrays of floating point numbers to multi-dimensional arrays of floating point numbers (tensors). What is special about these functions is that they are differentiable (yes, exactly as you remember from middle school calculus), which allows them to be trained using back propagation. The programming language community has also discovered that there is a deep connection between back propagation and continuations. Moreover, when you look closely at how Software 2.0 Engineers construct complex neural nets like {CNNs}, {RNNs}, {LSTMs}, … you recognize they are (implicitly) using high-order combinators like map, fold, zip, scan, recursion, conditionals, function composition, … to compose complex neural network architectures out of simple building blocks. Constructing neural networks using pure and higher-order differentiable functions and training them using reverse-mode automatic differentiation is unsurprisingly called Differentiable Programming. This talk will illustrate the deep programming language principles behind Differentiable Programming, which will hopefully inspire the working Software 1.0 engineer to pay serious attention to the threats and opportunities of Software 2.0.},

These vehicle systems include advanced driver assistance systems and vehicle guidance systems. The development process proposed in the {ISO} 26262 standard is based upon multiple V-models, and defines activities and work products for each process step. In many of these process steps, scenario based approaches can be applied to achieve the defined work products for the development of automated driving functions. To accomplish the work products of different process steps, scenarios have to focus on various aspects like a human understandable notation or a description via state variables. This leads to contradictory requirements regarding the level of detail and way of notation for the representation of scenarios. In this paper, the authors discuss requirements for the representation of scenarios in different process steps defined by the {ISO} 26262 standard, propose a consistent terminology based on prior publications for the identified levels of abstraction, and demonstrate how scenarios can be systematically evolved along the phases of the development process outlined in the {ISO} 26262 standard.},

A number of automated strategies have been proposed to explore dangerous scenarios, like search-based strategies guided by fitness functions. However, such strategies are likely to produce many uninteresting scenarios, representing so extreme driving situations that fatal accidents are unavoidable irrespective of the action of the {ADAS}. We propose leveraging datasets from real drives to better align the virtual scenarios to reasonable ones. The alignment is based on a simple distance metric that relates the virtual scenario parameters to the real data. We demonstrate the use of this metric for testing an autonomous emergency braking ({AEB}) system, taking the {highD} dataset as a reference for normal situations. We show how search-based testing quickly converges toward very distant scenarios that do not bring much insight into the {AEB} performance. We then provide an example of a distance-aware strategy that searches for less extreme scenarios that the {AEB} cannot overcome.},

  abstract   = {We present a method for 3D object detection and pose estimation from a single image. In contrast to current techniques that only regress the 3D orientation of an object, our method first regresses relatively stable 3D object properties using a deep convolutional neural network and then combines these estimates with geometric constraints provided by a 2D object bounding box to produce a complete 3D bounding box. The first network output estimates the 3D object orientation using a novel hybrid discrete-continuous loss, which significantly outperforms the L2 loss. The second output regresses the 3D object dimensions, which have relatively little variance compared to alternatives and can often be predicted for many object types. These estimates, combined with the geometric constraints on translation imposed by the 2D bounding box, enable us to recover a stable and accurate 3D object pose. We evaluate our method on the challenging {KITTI} object detection benchmark both on the official metric of 3D orientation estimation and also on the accuracy of the obtained 3D bounding boxes. Although conceptually simple, our method outperforms more complex and computationally expensive approaches that leverage semantic segmentation, instance level segmentation and flat ground priors and sub-category detection. Our discrete-continuous loss also produces state of the art results for 3D viewpoint estimation on the Pascal 3D+ dataset.},

  volume   = {1},
  abstract = {Simulation-based testing is the standard practice for assessing the reliability of self-driving car software before deployment on public roads. Many automated testing techniques generate challenging simulation scenarios to maximize failure detection. However, these techniques require executing a large number of test cases to expose realistic failures. Yet, failure-free test cases may still contain segments where the autonomous driving system was close to a failure. These near misses are often overlooked, reducing testing effectiveness. This paper focuses on enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of automated testing for autonomous driving systems by focusing on near misses observed during simulation-based testing. Our approach, implemented in a tool called Foresee, identifies potential near misses using a misbehavior forecaster that computes possible future states of the ego-vehicle under test. Foresee performs local fuzzing in the neighborhood of each candidate near miss to surface previously unknown failures. In our empirical study, we evaluate the effectiveness of different configurations of Foresee using several scenarios provided in the {CARLA} simulator. Our results show that Foresee is both more effective and more efficient than the baselines. Foresee exposes 124.14\% and 63.87\% more failures than a random approach and a state-of-the-art failure predictor while being 2.62x and 1.44x faster, respectively.},

  abstract  = {The big valley hypothesis suggests that, in combinatorial optimisation, local optima of good quality are clustered and surround the global optimum. We show here that the idea of a single valley does not always hold. Instead the big valley seems to de-construct into several valleys, also called ‘funnels’ in theoretical chemistry. We use the local optima networks model and propose an effective procedure for extracting the network data. We conduct a detailed study on four selected {TSP} instances of moderate size and observe that the big valley decomposes into a number of sub-valleys of different sizes and fitness distributions. Sometimes the global optimum is located in the largest valley, which suggests an easy to search landscape, but this is not generally the case. The global optimum might be located in a small valley, which offers a clear and visual explanation of the increased search difficulty in these cases. Our study opens up new possibilities for analysing and visualising combinatorial landscapes as complex networks.},

In fact, due to the possibly unpredictable nature of Artificial Intelligence ({AI}), its use in autonomous cars creates concerns that need to be addressed using appropriate V\&V processes that can address trustworthy {AI} and safe autonomy. In this study, the relevant research literature in recent years has been systematically reviewed and classified in order to investigate the state-of-the-art in the software V\&V of autonomous cars. By appropriate criteria, a subset of primary studies has been selected for more in-depth analysis. The first part of the review addresses certification issues against reference standards, challenges in assessing machine learning, as well as general V\&V methodologies. The second part investigates more specific approaches, including simulation environments and mutation testing, corner cases and adversarial examples, fault injection, software safety cages, techniques for cyber-physical systems, and formal methods. Relevant approaches and related tools have been discussed and compared in order to highlight open issues and opportunities.},

Using the autonomous driving scenario databases for testing can greatly shorten the test time and cost, and can improve the safety and reliability of the test. By systematically sorting out a large number of related publications, this paper summarizes the research progress of autonomous driving scenarios and scenario databases. The article firstly compares and analyzes the different definitions of autonomous driving scenarios, clarifies the connotation of the scenarios, summarizes the types of elements of the scenarios, and introduces the scenario layered model; secondly, we outline the description standards of scenario. We mainly summarize the two scenario data formats, {OpenDRIVE} and {OpenSCENARIO}, which are commonly used in the world. Thirdly, the scenario data collection and research work carried out at home and abroad is reviewed from the perspective of scenario data sources, and different datasets are compared; In addition, the definition of the scenario database, the construction process of the scenario database and the typical scenario databases are summarized; Finally, the problems and future development trends of autonomous driving scenarios and scenario databases are discussed and prospected.},

Testing collision avoidance systems is generally done by means of scenario-based testing using simulators and comes with the main challenge of generating situations that are realistic but avoidable. In other words, driving scenarios must stress the collision avoidance functionalities while being representative. Existing crash databases and accident reports describe observed accidents and enable to (re)create realistic collisions in simulations; however, as those data sources focus on the impact, their data do not generally lead to avoidable collision scenarios. To address this issue, we propose {STRETCH}, which generates realistic, critical, and avoidable collision scenarios by extending focused collision descriptions using a multi-objective optimization algorithm. Thanks to {STRETCH}, developers and testers can automatically generate challenging test cases based on realistic crash scenarios.},

However, the term scenario generation is used for many different methods, e.g., extraction of scenarios from naturalistic driving data or variation of scenario parameters. This survey aims to give a systematic overview of different approaches, establish different categories of scenario acquisition and generation, and show that each group of methods has typical input and output types. It shows that although the term is often used throughout literature, the evaluated methods use different inputs and the resulting scenarios differ in abstraction level and from a systematical point of view. Additionally, recent research and literature examples are given to underline this categorization.},

Substantial real-world testing or massive driving data collection does not scale since the potential test scenarios in real-world traffic are infinite, and covering large shares of them in the test is impractical. Thus, critical ones have to be prioritized. We have developed an approach for critical test scenario identification and in this study, we implement the approach and validate it on two real autonomous driving systems from industry by integrating it into their tool-chain.

                  {ADS}
                  ) have made great achievements in recent years thanks to the efforts from both academia and industry. A typical {ADS} is composed of multiple modules, including sensing, perception, planning, and control, which brings together the latest advances in different domains. Despite these achievements, safety assurance of {ADS} is of great significance, since unsafe behavior of {ADS} can bring catastrophic consequences. Testing has been recognized as an important system validation approach that aims to expose unsafe system behavior; however, in the context of {ADS}, it is extremely challenging to devise effective testing techniques, due to the high complexity and multidisciplinarity of the systems. There has been great much literature that focuses on the testing of {ADS}, and a number of surveys have also emerged to summarize the technical advances. Most of the surveys focus on the system-level testing performed within software simulators, and they thereby ignore the distinct features of different modules. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on the existing {ADS} testing literature, which takes into account both module-level and system-level testing. Specifically, we make the following contributions: (1) we survey the module-level testing techniques for {ADS} and highlight the technical differences affected by the features of different modules; (2) we also survey the system-level testing techniques, with focuses on the empirical studies that summarize the issues occurring in system development or deployment, the problems due to the collaborations between different modules, and the gap between {ADS} testing in simulators and the real world; (3) we identify the challenges and opportunities in {ADS} testing, which pave the path to the future research in this field.},

In accordance with recent research projects including academia and the automotive industry, the Regulation utilizes scenario based testing for the safety assessment. The complexity of safety validation of automated driving systems necessitates system-level simulations. The Regulation, however, is missing the required parameterization necessary for test case generation. To overcome this problem, we incorporate the exposure and consider the heterogeneous behavior of the traffic participants by extracting concrete scenarios according to Regulation's scenario definition from the established naturalistic highway dataset {highD}. We present a methodology to find the scenarios in real-world data, extract the parameters for modeling the scenarios and transfer them to simulation. In this process, more than 340 scenarios were extracted. {OpenSCENARIO} files were generated to enable an exemplary transfer of the scenarios to {CARLA} and esmini. We compare the trajectories to examine the similarity of the scenarios in the simulation to the recorded scenarios. In order to foster research, we publish the resulting dataset called {ConScenD} together with instructions for usage with both simulation tools.

  abstract     = {A reliable critical-scenario-based safety assessment of autonomous vehicles in China requires a thorough understanding of complex crash scenarios in Chinese background traffic. Based on actual crashes between a vehicle and a powered two-wheeler ({PTW}) in China, this study generated the autonomous driving testing scenarios from functional, logical and concrete levels. First, 239 video-recorded crash cases were selected from the China In-depth mobility Safety Study - Traffic Accident ({CIMSS}-{TA}) database. Using the k-medoids clustering method, six functional scenarios were generalized according to seven crash characteristics (time of day, road type, road surface, obstruction, motion of vehicle, motion of {PTW}, relative moving direction and position of {PTW} with respect to vehicle), which contained two straight road scenarios, two T-junction scenarios and two intersection scenarios. Then, using a trajectory analysis program written by Python, the dangerous time instant of each crash was extracted based on the relative trajectory. According to five dynamic parameters of dangerous time instant, namely vehicle velocity (Vehicle\_V), {PTW} X'-coordinate velocity ({PTW}\_VX'), {PTW} Y'-coordinate velocity ({PTW}\_VY'), {PTW} X'-coordinate relative position ({PTW}\_LocX') and {PTW} Y'-coordinate relative position ({PTW}\_LocY'), a crash trigger scheme was built to remain a case challenging when the involved vehicle is replaced by an autonomous vehicle with completely different maneuvers. Using the kernel density estimation ({KDE}), the logical scenarios were evolved by calculating the distribution of these dynamic parameters in each cluster. The results showed that there were differences in the distribution of dynamic parameters between six functional scenarios. For instance, the Vehicle\_V in the scenario where a vehicle turning right impacts with a right/right rear {PTW} traveling straight ahead was higher than that in the scenario where a vehicle changing to the left lane impacts with a left/left rear {PTW} traveling straight ahead, with ranges of (10 km/h, 30 km/h) and (5 km/h, 15 km/h), respectively. Finally, considering the correlation of dynamic parameters, a virtual crash generation approach based on the independent component analysis ({ICA}) representing the original crashes with independent parameters was proposed to obtain sufficient concrete testing scenarios. The results showed that the statistical characteristics of virtual crashes were consistent with those of original crashes. Therefore, the virtual crash generation approach was effective. And a concrete crossing testing scenario with the crash trigger conditions of Vehicle\_V = 26.272 km/h, {PTW}\_VX' = 15.567 km/h, {PTW}\_VY' = −1.670 km/h, {PTW}\_LocX' = −27.265 m and {PTW}\_LocY' = 52. 149 m was especially demonstrated. This study provides a theoretical basis for generating autonomous driving testing scenarios and data support for establishing relevant testing schemes tailored to the traffic environment in China.},

  abstract   = {In many scientiﬁc research and engineering applications, where repeated simulations of complex systems are conducted, a surrogate is commonly adopted to quickly estimate the whole system. To reduce the expensive cost of generating training examples, it has become a promising approach to combine the results of low-ﬁdelity (fast but inaccurate) and high-ﬁdelity (slow but accurate) simulations. Despite the fast developments of multi-ﬁdelity fusion techniques, most existing methods require particular data structures and do not scale well to high-dimensional output. To resolve these issues, we generalize the classic autoregression ({AR}), which is wildly used due to its simplicity, robustness, accuracy, and tractability, and propose generalized autoregression ({GAR}) using tensor formulation and latent features. {GAR} can deal with arbitrary dimensional outputs and arbitrary multiﬁdelity data structure to satisfy the demand of multi-ﬁdelity fusion for complex problems; it admits a fully tractable likelihood and posterior requiring no approximate inference and scales well to high-dimensional problems. Furthermore, we prove the autokrigeability theorem based on {GAR} in the multi-ﬁdelity case and develop {CIGAR}, a simpliﬁed {GAR} with the same predictive mean accuracy but requires signiﬁcantly less computation. In experiments of canonical {PDEs} and scientiﬁc computational examples, the proposed method consistently outperforms the {SOTA} methods with a large margin (up to 6x improvement in {RMSE}) with only a few high-ﬁdelity training samples.},

  abstract   = {Autonomous driving ({AD}) is getting closer to our life, but the severe traffic accidents of autonomous vehicle ({AV}) happened in the past several years warn us that the safety of {AVs} is still a big challenge for the {AD} industry. Before volume production, the automotive industry and regulators must ensure the {AV} can deal with dangerous scenarios. Although road test is the most common method to test the performance and safety of an {AV}, it has some manifest disadvantages, e.g., highly risky and unrepeatable, low efficiency and lack of useful critical scenarios. Critical-scenario-based simulation can effectively address these problems and become an important complement to road test. In this paper, we present a novel approach to extract critical scenarios from real traffic accident videos and re-generate them in a simulator. We also introduce our integrated toolkit for scenario extraction and scenario test. With the toolkit, we can build a critical scenario library quickly and use it as a benchmark for {AV} safety assessment, among other purposes. On top of this, we further introduce our safety assessment criteria and scoring method.},

  abstract   = {As the development of the autonomous vehicles, the test and evaluation of the autonomy of autonomous vehicles has receiving considerable attentions from both academic and industrial research fields recently. How to rapid identify the performance boundaries of autonomous vehicles and then to accelerate the testing has been considered as one of the most important problems. Simulation test and challenging scenarios are considered as two effective ways to solve above problems. In this research, a framework of rapid generation of challenging simulation scenarios based on adversarial test was proposed. An optimization model based on newly developed indicators, i.e., safety, smoothness, sharpness and smartness, was proposed to assess the autonomy of autonomous vehicles. Due to the high dimensionality of the configuration space and computation complexity of the optimization problem, a quantum genetic algorithm was employed to solve the optimization problem owing to its high search ability and lower population size required. A simulation system based on Prescan, Carsim and Simulink was built to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Comparative experiments also were conducted to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed optimization algorithm.},

  abstract   = {Automated Driving Systems ({ADSS}) have seen rapid progress in recent years. To ensure the safety and reliability of these systems, extensive testings are being conducted before their future mass deployment. Testing the system on the road is the closest to real-world and desirable approach, but it is incredibly costly. Also, it is infeasible to cover rare corner cases using such real-world testing. Thus, a popular alternative is to evaluate an {ADS}’s performance in some well-designed challenging scenarios, a.k.a. scenario-based testing. High-ﬁdelity simulators have been widely used in this setting to maximize ﬂexibility and convenience in testing what-if scenarios. Although many works have been proposed offering diverse frameworks/methods for testing speciﬁc systems, the comparisons and connections among these works are still missing. To bridge this gap, in this work, we provide a generic formulation of scenario-based testing in high-ﬁdelity simulation and conduct a literature review on the existing works. We further compare them and present the open challenges as well as potential future research directions.},

  abstract   = {In order to verify and validate autonomous vehicles, testbeds integrating the whole system from perception to actuation are necessary. Above all, this applies to the assessment of the autonomous vehicle's performance in the presence of vulnerable road users' behavior: While experiments for the interaction between autonomous vehicles and pedestrians in critical traffic scenarios are hardly conductable in reality, virtual experiments often suffer from plausibility. In order to solve this issue, we present a mixed reality testbed for the verification and validation of autonomous vehicles faced with realistic road user behavior in critical, worst case traffic scenarios. We achieve this by registering an immersed pedestrian and the automated driving function within a common environment model, providing challenging traffic scenarios. The testbed is applicable within different integration levels of the automated driving function and enables a high level of behavioral realism. The testbed is evaluated qualitatively and discussed within a concrete use case.},

  abstract     = {Assessing the quality of Deep Learning ({DL}) systems is crucial, as they are increasingly adopted in safety-critical domains. Researchers have proposed several input generation techniques for {DL} systems. While such techniques can expose failures, they do not explain which features of the test inputs influenced the system’s (mis-) behaviour. {DeepHyperion} was the first test generator to overcome this limitation by exploring the {DL} systems’ feature space at large. In this article, we propose {DeepHyperion}-{CS}, a test generator for {DL} systems that enhances {DeepHyperion} by promoting the inputs that contributed more to feature space exploration during the previous search iterations. We performed an empirical study involving two different test subjects (i.e., a digit classifier and a lane-keeping system for self-driving cars). Our results proved that the contribution-based guidance implemented within {DeepHyperion}-{CS} outperforms state-of-the-art tools and significantly improves the efficiency and the effectiveness of {DeepHyperion}. {DeepHyperion}-{CS} exposed significantly more misbehaviours for five out of six feature combinations and was up to 65\% more efficient than {DeepHyperion} in finding misbehaviour-inducing inputs and exploring the feature space. {DeepHyperion}-{CS} was useful for expanding the datasets used to train the {DL} systems, populating up to 200\% more feature map cells than the original training set.},
